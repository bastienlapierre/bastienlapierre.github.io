Hello there! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Princeton University, working with Prof. Shinsei Ryu. I obtained my PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics from the University of ZÃ¼rich in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Titus Neupert and Dr. Luka Trifunovic.

My research focuses on various aspects of modern condensed matter theory, such as the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems, the interplay between topological phases of matter and Anderson localization, as well as the geometry of the quantum Hall effect.

You can find my publications on the arXiv and on Google Scholar.
