I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University, working with [Shinsei Ryu](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/shinsei-ryu). I obtained my PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics from the University of ZÃ¼rich in 2023, under the supervision of [Titus Neupert](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team/neupert.html) and [Luka Trifunovic](https://www.lpt.ups-tlse.fr/spip.php?article1624&lang=fr).

My research focuses on various aspects of modern condensed matter theory, such as the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems, the interplay between topological phases of matter and Anderson localization, as well as the geometry of the quantum Hall effect.

You can find my publications on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/lapierre_b_1.html) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oGgrqHgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
