Hi! I am a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, working with [Shinsei Ryu](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/shinsei-ryu). I obtained my PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics from the University of ZÃ¼rich in 2023, under the supervision of [Titus Neupert](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert/team/neupert.html) and [Luka Trifunovic](https://www.lpt.ups-tlse.fr/spip.php?article1624&lang=fr).

I aim to theoretically design new phases of quantum matter that emerge both in and out-of-equilibrium, and to understand the universality that underpins them. These include far-from-equilibrium phases arising in driven, dissipative or monitored quantum critical systems, as well as novel topological phases unique to strongly disordered matter.
I employ various methods from condensed matter and quantum many-body physics to construct concrete models, and explore their phase diagrams and their underlying universality classes.

Some questions that I am currently investigating include:
- Do driven critical systems heat up and scramble in a universal way? [[1](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023085), [2](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.224303), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01642)]
- Are there phases unique to quasiperiodically driven systems?
- Can there be any topology in a fully localized insulator? [[4](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.256401)]
- Can one hear the shape of a quantum Hall droplet? [[5](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.011030)].

You can find my publications on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/lapierre_b_1.html) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oGgrqHgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
